Certainly! Here is a comprehensive list of 100 CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) interview questions, covering a range of topics from basic to advanced:

### Basics

1. What is Continuous Integration (CI), and why is it important?
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves integrating code changes into a central repository frequently, usually through automated processes. This approach helps detect and fix errors early, reducing the risk of downstream problems and improving overall software quality. CI is essential because it enables teams to deliver software faster, with higher quality, and at a lower cost. By automating testing, building, and deployment, CI ensures that the software is thoroughly tested and validated before it reaches production, minimizing the risk of errors and downtime.
