Certainly! Here’s a comprehensive real-life problem scenario involving a full stack development environment with Node.js, React.js, Python, GCP, AWS, and Terraform:

### CASE 1:

1. E-Commerce Platform Migration and Scaling

Scenario: E-Commerce Platform Migration and Scaling

Project Overview:

You are working on an e-commerce platform that is currently hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The platform is built with a Node.js backend, a React.js frontend, and uses Python for some data processing tasks. The infrastructure includes GCP services like Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, and Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The team has decided to migrate the infrastructure to AWS for cost reasons and to leverage AWS's scaling capabilities. Terraform is used for infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage the infrastructure.

Key Requirements:

1. Migrate the entire application stack from GCP to AWS.
2. Ensure minimal downtime and data consistency during the migration.
3. Set up the infrastructure in AWS using Terraform.
4. Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment.
5. Ensure the system scales effectively to handle increased traffic.

### Detailed Steps to Solve the Problem

#### 1. Infrastructure Mapping

GCP to AWS Service Mapping:
- Node.js Backend (GCP) → Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate (for containerized apps)
- React.js Frontend (GCP) → Amazon S3 + CloudFront (for static site hosting)
- Python Data Processing (GCP) → AWS Lambda or EC2
- Cloud SQL (GCP) → Amazon RDS
- Cloud Storage (GCP) → Amazon S3
- Kubernetes Engine (GKE) (GCP) → Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

#### 2. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Terraform Configuration:
- Define AWS Providers: Configure AWS provider in Terraform to manage AWS resources.
- Create Terraform Modules: Define modules for EC2, RDS, S3, and EKS.
- Migrate Terraform Scripts: Convert existing GCP Terraform scripts to AWS-compatible scripts.

Example Terraform Code Snippets:

- Amazon EC2 Instance:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
    ami           = "ami-12345678"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    ...
  }
  ```

- Amazon RDS:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
    allocated_storage    = 20
    storage_type         = "gp2"
    engine               = "mysql"
    instance_class       = "db.t2.micro"
    ...
  }
  ```

- Amazon S3:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_s3_bucket" "static_site" {
    bucket = "my-static-site-bucket"
    ...
  }
  ```

- Amazon EKS:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_eks_cluster" "example" {
    name     = "my-cluster"
    role_arn  = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/eks-cluster-role"
    ...
  }
  ```

#### 3. Application Deployment

Node.js Backend Deployment:
- Containerize Node.js Application: Create Docker images for the Node.js backend.
- Deploy on AWS ECS or EKS: Use Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS to run Docker containers.

React.js Frontend Deployment:
- Host React App on S3: Build the React application and deploy the static files to an S3 bucket.
- Use CloudFront: Set up CloudFront to distribute content globally.

Python Data Processing:
- AWS Lambda: For serverless execution, package Python scripts and deploy them to AWS Lambda.
- EC2: Alternatively, run Python scripts on EC2 instances.

#### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild:
- Source Stage: Connect to the code repository (GitHub or CodeCommit).
- Build Stage: Use CodeBuild to build Docker images and package applications.
- Deploy Stage: Deploy applications to ECS/EKS, update Lambda functions, and synchronize S3 buckets.


#### 5. Scaling and Optimization

- Set Up Auto-Scaling: Configure auto-scaling policies for EC2 instances and EKS pods to handle varying traffic loads.
- Monitor and Optimize: Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor application performance and set up alarms for high usage. Optimize based on performance metrics.

#### 6. Testing and Validation

- Functional Testing: Ensure all features work as expected after migration.
- Performance Testing: Conduct load tests to verify the system can handle expected traffic.
- Data Consistency Checks: Validate that all data has been correctly migrated and is consistent.

### Summary

Migrating an e-commerce platform from GCP to AWS involves mapping services, setting up equivalent infrastructure using Terraform, deploying applications, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring proper scaling and optimization. Each step requires careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption.
