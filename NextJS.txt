Certainly! Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of 100 Next.js interview questions, covering a range of topics from basic to advanced:

### Basics

1. What is Next.js and what are its main features?
Next.js is a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated websites and applications. Its main features include support for SSR, static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration (ISR), which enable fast and scalable rendering of web pages. Additionally, Next.js provides built-in support for internationalization, API routes, and serverless deployment.

2. How does Next.js differ from Create React App?
Next.js differs from Create React App in its support for server-side rendering, static site generation, and incremental static regeneration. While Create React App is a great tool for building client-side rendered React applications, Next.js is designed for building more complex and scalable applications that require server-side rendering and static site generation. Next.js also provides more advanced features, such as API routes and serverless deployment, which are not available in Create React App.

3. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js?
Server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js is a feature that allows you to pre-render pages on the server before sending them to the client. This enables fast and scalable rendering of web pages, as the server can handle the rendering process instead of the client. SSR is particularly useful for applications that require fast page loads and high search engine optimization (SEO).

4. What is static site generation (SSG) in Next.js?
Static site generation (SSG) in Next.js is a feature that allows you to generate static HTML files for your website or application at build time. This enables fast and scalable rendering of web pages, as the static HTML files can be served directly by a CDN or web server. SSG is particularly useful for applications that have mostly static content and do not require server-side rendering.

5. Explain the concept of incremental static regeneration (ISR) in Next.js.
Incremental static regeneration (ISR) in Next.js is a feature that allows you to regenerate static HTML files incrementally, without requiring a full rebuild of the website or application. This enables fast and efficient updates to static content, as only the changed pages need to be re-generated. ISR is particularly useful for applications that have a large amount of static content and require frequent updates.

6. How do you set up a new Next.js project?
To set up a new Next.js project, you can use the `create-next-app` command, which is a tool provided by the Next.js team. Simply run the command in your terminal, and follow the prompts to create a new Next.js project. Alternatively, you can create a new Next.js project from scratch by installing the required dependencies and setting up the project structure manually.

7. What is the purpose of the `pages` directory in a Next.js project?
The `pages` directory in a Next.js project is where you define the routes for your website or application. Each file in the `pages` directory corresponds to a specific route, and the file name determines the URL path for that route. For example, a file called `index.js` in the `pages` directory would correspond to the root URL (`/`) of your website or application.

8. How does Next.js handle routing?
Next.js handles routing using the file system. Each file in the `pages` directory corresponds to a specific route, and the file name determines the URL path for that route. Next.js also supports dynamic routing, which allows you to define routes that contain parameters. For example, a file called `[id].js` in the `pages` directory would correspond to a route that contains an `id` parameter.

9. What are API routes in Next.js and how do you use them?
API routes in Next.js are server-side endpoints that allow you to handle API requests and return data in a format like JSON. To use API routes, you create a file in the `pages/api` directory, and export a function that handles the API request. For example, a file called `users.js` in the `pages/api` directory would correspond to an API route that handles requests to `/api/users`.

10. How do you configure custom headers and redirects in Next.js?
To configure custom headers and redirects in Next.js, you can use the `next.config.js` file. This file allows you to define custom headers and redirects for your website or application. For example, you can define a custom header to set the `Content-Security-Policy` for your website or application, or define a redirect to redirect users from one URL to another.


### Pages and Routing

11. How do you create dynamic routes in Next.js?
Dynamic routes in Next.js can be created using the `pages` directory and the `getStaticPaths` function. To create a dynamic route, create a new file in the `pages` directory with a name that includes a parameter, such as `[id].js`. Then, in the file, use the `getStaticPaths` function to define the possible values for the parameter. For example:
```
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function Post({ post }) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <div>{post}</div>;
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({ params: { id: post.id } }));

  return { paths, fallback: false };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`);
  return { props: { post } };
}
```
This code creates a dynamic route for a blog post, where the `id` parameter is used to fetch the post data from an API.

12. What is the difference between `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`?
`getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` are both used to pre-render pages in Next.js, but they differ in when and how the pre-rendering occurs. `getStaticProps` is used for static site generation (SSG), where the page is pre-rendered at build time and served statically. `getServerSideProps` is used for server-side rendering (SSR), where the page is pre-rendered on each request. `getStaticProps` is faster and more efficient, but `getServerSideProps` provides more flexibility and is better suited for pages that require dynamic data.

13. How do you fetch data at build time with `getStaticProps`?
`getStaticProps` can be used to fetch data at build time by making API requests within the function. For example:
```
import { fetch } from 'node-fetch';

function HomePage({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}
```
This code fetches data from an API at build time and passes it as a prop to the `HomePage` component.

14. How do you fetch data on each request with `getServerSideProps`?
`getServerSideProps` can be used to fetch data on each request by making API requests within the function. For example:
```
import { fetch } from 'node-fetch';

function HomePage({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}
```
This code fetches data from an API on each request and passes it as a prop to the `HomePage` component.

15. What is `getStaticPaths` and how is it used?
`getStaticPaths` is a function that is used in conjunction with `getStaticProps` to define the possible values for a parameter in a dynamic route. It returns an array of objects, where each object contains a `params` property with the possible values for the parameter. For example:
```
import { fetch } from 'node-fetch';

function Post({ post }) {
  return <div>{post}</div>;
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({ params: { id: post.id } }));

  return { paths, fallback: false };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`);
  return { props: { post } };
}
```
This code defines a dynamic route for a blog post, where the `id` parameter is used to fetch the post data from an API.

16. How do you handle 404 pages in Next.js?
404 pages in Next.js can be handled by creating a custom page component and using the `getStaticPaths` function to define the possible values for the parameter. For example:
```
function NotFoundPage() {
  return <div>404 Not Found</div>;
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return { paths: [], fallback: '404' };
}
```
This code creates a custom 404 page component and defines it as the fallback page for any unknown routes.

17. What is `next/link` and how do you use it for navigation?
`next/link` is a component that is used for client-side navigation in Next.js. It can be used to create links between pages, and it provides a way to pre-fetch pages in the background. For example:
```
import Link from 'next/link';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>


### Static and Dynamic Rendering

21. How do you enable incremental static regeneration (ISR) in Next.js?
To enable ISR in Next.js, you need to use the `getStaticProps` function to pre-render pages at build time. Then, you can use the `revalidate` property to specify the revalidation time for each page. For example: `export async function getStaticProps() { return { props: {}, revalidate: 10 }; }`. This will pre-render the page at build time and revalidate it every 10 seconds.

22. What are the benefits of using static site generation (SSG) over server-side rendering (SSR)?
SSG has several benefits over SSR, including faster page loads, improved SEO, and reduced server costs. With SSG, pages are pre-rendered at build time and served directly by a CDN, eliminating the need for server-side rendering.

23. How do you handle revalidation with ISR?
Revalidation with ISR is handled using the `revalidate` property in the `getStaticProps` function. This property specifies the revalidation time for each page. For example: `export async function getStaticProps() { return { props: {}, revalidate: 10 }; }`. This will revalidate the page every 10 seconds.

24. How do you configure caching for static assets in Next.js?
Caching for static assets in Next.js can be configured using the `next.config.js` file. You can use the `target` property to specify the caching strategy for each asset. For example: `module.exports = { target: 'serverless', };`. This will configure caching for static assets using a serverless strategy.

25. What is the difference between `getStaticProps` and client-side data fetching?
`getStaticProps` is used for pre-rendering pages at build time, while client-side data fetching is used for fetching data on the client-side after the page has been rendered. `getStaticProps` provides faster page loads and improved SEO, while client-side data fetching provides more dynamic and interactive experiences.

26. How do you use environment variables in a Next.js application?
Environment variables in Next.js can be used by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can then access these variables using the `process.env` object. For example: `console.log(process.env.MY_VARIABLE);`.
