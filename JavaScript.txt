Certainly! Here's a comprehensive list of 100 JavaScript interview questions that cover a range of topics from basic to advanced:

### Basics

1. What is JavaScript, and what are its main uses?
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting on the web. Its main uses include creating interactive web pages, web applications, mobile applications, and server-side programming with technologies like Node.js.

2. Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
`var` is a function-scoped variable declaration, `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, and `const` is a block-scoped constant declaration. `let` and `const` were introduced in ES6 to provide more control over variable scope and prevent common issues like variable hoisting.

3. What is a closure in JavaScript?
A closure is a function that has access to its outer function's scope, even when the outer function has returned. This allows the inner function to use and manipulate variables from the outer function's scope.

4. How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations?
JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, promises are objects that represent the eventual completion of an operation, and async/await is a syntax sugar on top of promises that makes asynchronous code look and feel synchronous.

5. What are JavaScript data types? Give examples.
JavaScript has several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, null, and undefined. Examples include `let num = 5;`, `let str = 'hello';`, `let bool = true;`, `let arr = [1, 2, 3];`, and `let obj = { name: 'John', age: 30 };`.

6. Explain the concept of hoisting.
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope, regardless of where they are actually defined. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood properly.

7. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
`==` is a loose equality operator that checks for value equality, while `===` is a strict equality operator that checks for both value and type equality.

8. How do you create an object in JavaScript?
You can create an object in JavaScript using the object literal syntax, `let obj = { key: value };`, or using the `Object.create()` method.

9. What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
The `this` keyword refers to the current execution context of a function. It can refer to the global object, a function's own scope, or an object that a function is called on.

10. What is event delegation?
Event delegation is a technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element, and then use the event target to determine which child element triggered the event. This can improve performance and simplify event handling.



### Functions

11. What is a callback function?
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed by that function. It's a way to pass a function as an argument to another function, allowing for more flexibility and control over the execution of the code.

12. How do arrow functions differ from regular functions?
Arrow functions are a concise way to define small, single-purpose functions. They have a shorter syntax, do not have their own `this` context, and do not support the `arguments` object. They are often used as callbacks or event handlers.

13. Explain the concept of function currying.
Function currying is a technique where a function takes multiple arguments, but instead of taking all of them at once, it takes the first argument and returns a new function that takes the remaining arguments. This allows for more flexibility and reusability of code.

14. What is a higher-order function?
A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result. They are often used to abstract away low-level details and provide a more functional programming style.

15. How can you create a private method in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, there is no strict concept of private methods, but you can achieve similar behavior using closures or the `#` symbol (private fields) introduced in ECMAScript 2020.

16. What is the `bind()` method and how does it work?
The `bind()` method creates a new function that has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

17. How do you handle errors in JavaScript?
JavaScript provides a built-in `try-catch` block to handle errors. You can also use `throw` to manually throw an error, and `finally` to execute code regardless of whether an error occurred.

18. What are IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)?
An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after it's defined. It's often used to create a new scope, avoid polluting the global namespace, or execute code only once.

19. Explain the concept of the `arguments` object in functions.
The `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to a function. It's available within the function's scope and can be used to access and manipulate the arguments.

20. What are generator functions and how do they work?
Generator functions are a type of function that can be paused and resumed during execution. They return an iterator object that produces a sequence of values, allowing for more efficient and flexible iteration over data.




### Objects and Arrays

21. How do you clone an object in JavaScript?
To clone an object in JavaScript, you can use the spread operator or Object.assign() method. The spread operator is a more concise way to clone an object, while Object.assign() is more flexible and allows you to merge multiple objects.

22. What is the difference between `Object.assign()` and spread operator for object copying?
The main difference between Object.assign() and the spread operator is that Object.assign() modifies the target object, while the spread operator creates a new object. Additionally, Object.assign() can handle nested objects, while the spread operator only clones the top-level properties.

23. Explain the concept of prototype inheritance.
Prototype inheritance is a mechanism in JavaScript where an object can inherit properties and methods from another object, known as its prototype. This allows for code reuse and a more efficient way of creating objects.

24. How do you check if an object has a property?
You can check if an object has a property using the in operator or the hasOwnProperty() method. The in operator checks if the property exists in the object or its prototype chain, while hasOwnProperty() only checks if the property exists in the object itself.

25. What are some common array methods in JavaScript?
Some common array methods in JavaScript include push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), slice(), and concat(). These methods allow you to manipulate and transform arrays in various ways.

26. How do you iterate over an array?
You can iterate over an array using a for loop, for...of loop, or array methods like forEach(), map(), and reduce(). The for...of loop is a more modern and concise way to iterate over arrays.

27. What is the purpose of `Array.prototype.reduce()`?
The reduce() method is used to apply a function to each element in an array and reduce it to a single value. It's commonly used to calculate sums, products, or other aggregate values.

28. How do you remove duplicates from an array?
You can remove duplicates from an array using the Set object or the filter() method. The Set object automatically removes duplicates, while the filter() method allows you to specify a condition for removing elements.

29. What is the difference between `map()` and `forEach()`?
The main difference between map() and forEach() is that map() returns a new array with the transformed elements, while forEach() does not return anything. forEach() is used for side effects, while map() is used for data transformation.

30. How can you sort an array of objects by a specific property?
You can sort an array of objects by a specific property using the sort() method and providing a compare function. The compare function takes two objects as arguments and returns a value that determines their order.




### ES6 and Beyond

31. What are template literals and how are they used?
Template literals are a feature in JavaScript that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using backticks (``) instead of quotes. They provide a more readable and efficient way to create strings, especially when working with variables or functions.

32. What is destructuring assignment and how does it work?
Destructuring assignment is a syntax in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables. It works by using the same syntax as array or object literals, but on the left side of an assignment.

33. How do default parameters work in functions?
Default parameters in JavaScript allow you to specify a default value for a function parameter, which is used if no value is provided when the function is called. This can simplify your code and make it more readable.

34. Explain the concept of modules in JavaScript.
Modules in JavaScript are a way to organize and structure your code into reusable pieces. They allow you to import and export variables, functions, and classes, making it easier to manage dependencies and avoid naming conflicts.

35. What is the `spread` operator and how is it used?
The spread operator in JavaScript is a syntax that allows you to expand an array or object into a new array or object. It's commonly used to merge arrays, create new objects, or pass arguments to functions.

36. What is the difference between `class` and `function` constructors?
In JavaScript, `class` and `function` constructors are both used to create objects, but they have different syntax and behavior. `class` constructors are part of the ES6 syntax and provide a more traditional object-oriented programming style, while `function` constructors are the traditional way of creating objects in JavaScript.

37. How do you handle asynchronous operations using `async/await`?
`async/await` is a syntax in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and feels synchronous. It's built on top of promises and provides a more readable and efficient way to handle asynchronous operations.

38. What is the purpose of `Promise.all()`?
`Promise.all()` is a method in JavaScript that takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves when all the promises in the array have resolved. It's commonly used to handle multiple asynchronous operations that need to be executed concurrently.

39. What are `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`?
`WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are data structures in JavaScript that allow you to store objects as keys or values, but with a weak reference. This means that the objects are not prevented from being garbage collected, which can help prevent memory leaks.

40. What is a `Symbol` and how is it used?
A `Symbol` in JavaScript is a unique and immutable value that can be used as a property key in objects. It's commonly used to create unique identifiers or to hide properties from the outside world.

41. How do you select an element in the DOM?
You can select an element in the DOM using the `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, or `document.querySelectorAll()` methods.

42. What are the differences between `getElementById()` and `querySelector()`?
`getElementById()` selects an element by its ID, while `querySelector()` selects an element by its CSS selector.

43. How do you add or remove a class from an element?
You can add or remove a class from an element using the `element.classList.add()` or `element.classList.remove()` methods.

44. What is event bubbling and how does it work?
Event bubbling is a process where an event propagates from the innermost element to the outermost element in the DOM.

45. How can you create and append new elements to the DOM?
You can create a new element using the `document.createElement()` method and append it to the DOM using the `parent.appendChild()` method.

46. What is the `event.target` property?
The `event.target` property refers to the element that triggered the event.

47. How do you prevent the default action of an event?
You can prevent the default action of an event using the `event.preventDefault()` method.

48. What is event delegation, and why is it useful?
Event delegation is a technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element and use the event target to determine which child element triggered the event.

49. How can you manipulate the attributes of an HTML element?
You can manipulate the attributes of an HTML element using the `element.getAttribute()` and `element.setAttribute()` methods.

50. What is the difference between `innerHTML` and `textContent`?
`innerHTML` returns the HTML content of an element, while `textContent` returns the text content of an element.

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. It's a key feature of React that enables efficient and fast rendering of components. When the state of a component changes, React updates the Virtual DOM, which is then compared to the real DOM. Only the differences are applied to the real DOM, minimizing the number of DOM mutations.

82. How does Angular handle two-way data binding?
Angular uses a mechanism called "zones" to handle two-way data binding. Zones are a way to group related components and services together, allowing Angular to detect changes to the data model and update the UI accordingly. When a user interacts with the UI, Angular updates the data model, which in turn updates the UI.

83. What is the purpose of Vue.js directives?
Vue.js directives are used to attach special behavior to HTML elements. They are essentially functions that are executed when the element is rendered or updated. Directives can be used to manipulate the element's attributes, style, or content.

84. Explain the concept of state management in Redux.
Redux is a state management library that helps manage global state by providing a single source of truth for state. It uses a store to hold the state, and actions to update the state. When an action is dispatched, the state is updated, and the UI is re-rendered.

85. How do you handle side effects in React with `useEffect`?
`useEffect` is a hook in React that allows you to handle side effects, such as making API calls or setting timers. It takes a function as an argument, which is executed after the component has rendered. The function can return a cleanup function, which is executed when the component is unmounted.
