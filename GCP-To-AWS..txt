To migrate your GCP-based project to AWS, you'll need to find equivalent AWS services for each of the GCP components you're using. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you map and deploy the resources:

### 1. Compute Resources

GCP: Kubernetes Engine (GKE)  
AWS Equivalent: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Steps:
- Set Up EKS: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or Terraform to create an EKS cluster.
- Migrate Configurations: Transfer your Kubernetes manifests and configurations from GKE to EKS. 
- Deploy Your Application: Use `kubectl` or CI/CD pipelines to deploy your Node.js and React applications to EKS.

### 2. Database

GCP: Cloud SQL  
AWS Equivalent: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

Steps:
- Set Up RDS: Create an RDS instance for your database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) using the AWS Management Console or CLI.
- Migrate Data: Use tools like AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) or `mysqldump`/`pg_dump` for migrating your database data from Cloud SQL to RDS.

### 3. Object Storage

GCP: Cloud Storage  
AWS Equivalent: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Steps:
- Set Up S3 Buckets: Create S3 buckets to store your objects (files, images, etc.).
- Migrate Data: Use the AWS CLI `aws s3 sync` command or third-party tools like CloudSync for data migration from GCP buckets to S3.

### 4. Search Service

GCP: Elasticsearch (managed by Elastic Cloud or similar)  
AWS Equivalent: Amazon OpenSearch Service (formerly Elasticsearch Service)

Steps:
- Set Up OpenSearch: Create an OpenSearch domain via the AWS Management Console or CLI.
- Migrate Data: Use tools or scripts to reindex your data from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch.

### 5. Streaming Platform

GCP: Kafka (self-managed or Confluent Cloud)  
AWS Equivalent: Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka)

Steps:
- Set Up MSK: Create a Kafka cluster in MSK using the AWS Management Console or CLI.
- Migrate Data: Configure your producers and consumers to use MSK and migrate data as necessary.

### 6. CI/CD

GCP: GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)  
AWS Equivalent: AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild or continue using GitHub Actions

Steps:
- Set Up CodePipeline: Configure CodePipeline to build and deploy your application.
- Set Up CodeBuild: Use CodeBuild to build your application, similar to how you use GitHub Actions.
- Alternatively: Continue using GitHub Actions for CI/CD and deploy to AWS using custom workflows or actions.

### Steps for Migrating CI/CD from GitHub Actions to AWS CodePipeline

1. Create a CodePipeline:
   - Go to AWS CodePipeline and create a new pipeline.
   - Define the source stage (e.g., GitHub repository).
   - Add build stages using AWS CodeBuild or other build providers.

2. Set Up CodeBuild Projects:
   - Create CodeBuild projects to handle the build process.
   - Define the buildspec file (`buildspec.yml`) for the build commands.

3. Deploy Artifacts:
   - Configure deployment stages in CodePipeline to deploy your applications to EKS, S3, or other targets.

### General Migration Steps

1. Prepare AWS Environment:
   - Set up AWS IAM roles and policies for secure access.
   - Configure networking (VPC, subnets, security groups) as required.

2. Deploy Applications:
   - Build Docker images for your Node.js and React applications.
   - Push Docker images to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) or use another container registry.

3. Test Thoroughly:
   - Ensure all services are properly configured and integrated.
   - Test the migrated application in the AWS environment to confirm it works as expected.

4. Monitor and Optimize:
   - Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
   - Optimize resources based on performance and cost.

5. Update DNS and Networking:
   - If necessary, update DNS settings to point to your new AWS infrastructure.
   - Configure any additional networking and security settings.

### Tools and Resources

- AWS Migration Hub: For tracking the migration progress.
- AWS Schema Conversion Tool: For database schema migration.
- AWS DataSync: For data migration between S3 and other storage solutions.

By following these steps, you can effectively migrate your GCP-based project to AWS, taking advantage of AWS’s cloud infrastructure and services.
