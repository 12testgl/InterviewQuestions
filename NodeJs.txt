Certainly! Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of 100 Node.js interview questions, ranging from basics to advanced topics:

### Basics

1. What is Node.js, and what are its main uses?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. 
Its main uses include building scalable and high-performance server-side applications, creating microservices, and developing real-time web applications.

2. Explain the event-driven architecture in Node.js.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking or waiting for each request 
to complete. This is achieved through the use of events, callbacks, and an event loop.

3. What is the role of the `package.json` file in a Node.js project?
The `package.json` file is used to manage dependencies, scripts, and metadata for a Node.js project. It contains information such as the project name,
 version, dependencies, and scripts.

4. How do you install packages using npm?
To install packages using npm, you can use the `npm install` command followed by the package name. For example, `npm install express` installs the Express.js framework.

5. What is the difference between `npm` and `yarn`?
`npm` and `yarn` are both package managers for Node.js, but they have some differences. `npm` is the default package manager for Node.js, 
while `yarn` is a faster and more secure alternative.

6. How do you create a basic HTTP server in Node.js?
To create a basic HTTP server in Node.js, you can use the `http` module and create a server using the `http.createServer()` method. For example:
```javascript
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

7. What is a callback function in Node.js?
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when a specific operation is complete. 
Callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations in Node.js.

8. How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?
Node.js handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await. These mechanisms allow Node.js to perform multiple operations concurrently 
without blocking or waiting for each operation to complete.

9. Explain the concept of the event loop in Node.js.
The event loop is a mechanism in Node.js that allows it to handle multiple requests concurrently. It works by executing a queue of events, such as I/O operations, 
and handling each event as it is completed.

10. What are streams in Node.js, and how are they used?
Streams in Node.js are a way to handle large amounts of data in a continuous flow. They are used to read and write data in chunks, allowing for efficient 
handling of large files and network requests.



### Modules and Packages

11. What is the CommonJS module system?
The CommonJS module system is a specification for JavaScript modules that allows developers to write modules that can be easily shared and reused across different projects. 
It provides a way to define modules, export and import functions and variables, and manage dependencies.

12. How do you export and import modules in Node.js?
In Node.js, you can export modules using the `module.exports` object, and import modules using the `require` function. For example:
```javascript
// exporting a module
module.exports = function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// importing a module
const add = require('./add');
console.log(add(2, 3)); // outputs 5
```

13. What is the purpose of the `require` function?
The `require` function is used to import modules in Node.js. It takes a module name or path as an argument and returns the exported module.

14. How do you create a custom module in Node.js?
To create a custom module in Node.js, you can create a new JavaScript file and define the module using the `module.exports` object. For example:
```javascript
// mymodule.js
module.exports = function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```
You can then import and use the module in another file:
```javascript
// main.js
const greet = require('./mymodule');
greet('John'); // outputs "Hello, John!"
```

15. What are the differences between `require()` and `import` statements?
`require()` is a function used to import modules in CommonJS, while `import` is a statement used to import modules in ES6. The main difference is that `import` is a declarative syntax, 
while `require()` is a function call.


16. How do you use the `exports` and `module.exports` objects?
The `exports` object is a shortcut for `module.exports`, and can be used to export variables and functions from a module. For example:
```javascript
// mymodule.js
exports.greet = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```
You can then import and use the module in another file:
```javascript
// main.js
const mymodule = require('./mymodule');
mymodule.greet('John'); // outputs "Hello, John!"
```

17. What is `node_modules`, and how does it work?
`node_modules` is a directory where Node.js stores installed packages. When you run `npm install`, packages are installed in the `node_modules` directory, and can be imported using the `require` function.

18. How do you manage package dependencies in Node.js?
You can manage package dependencies in Node.js using the `package.json` file and the `npm` command. The `package.json` file lists the dependencies required by your project, and `npm` can be used 
to install and manage those dependencies.

19. What is a package lock file, and why is it important?
A package lock file is a file that lists the exact versions of packages installed in a project. It is important because it ensures that the same versions of packages are installed across different
 environments, which helps to prevent bugs and inconsistencies.

20. How do you create and use a `.env` file for environment variables?
A `.env` file is a file that stores environment variables for a project. You can create a `.env` file in the root of your project, and add environment variables in the format `VARIABLE_NAME=value`. 
You can then import the `.env` file in your code using the `dotenv` package.
