Certainly! Here's a comprehensive list of 100 ReactJS interview questions that cover a range of topics from basics to advanced concepts:

### Basics

1. What is React, and why is it used?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used for its efficiency, flexibility, and large community.

2. Explain the concept of components in React.
Components are the building blocks of React applications, representing UI elements or pieces of the UI.

3. What are props in React? How do they work?
Props are short for "properties" and are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

4. What is state in React? How is it different from props?
State is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves. Unlike props, state is managed by the component itself.

5. How do you create a functional component in React?
A functional component is created using a function that returns JSX.

6. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

7. What is the purpose of the `render()` method in class components?
The `render()` method is used to render the JSX that makes up the component.

8. How do you handle events in React?
Events are handled using event handlers, which are functions that are called in response to a specific event.

9. What are the lifecycle methods in React?
Lifecycle methods are methods that are called at different points during a component's life cycle.

10. Explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React.
Lifting state up involves moving the state from a child component to a parent component.



### Components and Props

Answer: PropTypes is used to validate the types of props passed to a component.

15. How do you conditionally render components in React?
Answer: You can conditionally render components in React using the && operator or a ternary expression.

20. How do you create reusable components in React?
Answer: You can create reusable components in React by breaking down your UI into smaller, reusable pieces.


### State Management
21. What is the `useState` hook, and how does it work?
Answer: The `useState` hook is a built-in React hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and an `updateState` function.

24. How does the Context API help with state management?
Answer: The Context API provides a way to share state between components without passing props down manually. It's useful for managing global state.

25. What is the purpose of `useContext` in React?
Answer: The `useContext` hook allows you to access context (shared state) in a functional component.

26. How do you implement a global state management solution in React?
